# NEW CS COURSE FOR MY SCHOOL
* ## Name:
      "Making Things Happen"
* ## General Description: 
      It would be a selective course that is complementary to the current 2 Career & Tech pathways that our school offers (Digial Media & Computer Science), but with a focus on engineering aspects of computer science-related fields.
  * UNIT 1 would review design thinking through a set of brief but highly engaging challenges; also, this will serve as a breif re-cap of previously used tools/tech/hardware/software/machines from both pathways as well as introduce new ones that they we have access to and they can incorporate more deeply into their problem solving process
  * UNIT 2 would focus on applying the CTE skills learned in 9th grade to a daily or personal problem experienced at home or at school
  * UNIT 3 would be similar application but for a community problem within our school, with an added focus on design thinking to ideate, iterate, and deliver successfully to a target audience.
  * UNIT 4 would be address a neighborhood, city, or global problem and add a new focus to researching in more varied ways and collaborating with expert towards a solution. The experts would be matched up with the students based on the problem that resonates the most with them,  feels most urgent, or is most interesting. In addition to delivering the final solution or prototype, inisghts and statistics from that specific profession and its corresponding career pathway will be shared with other students

## TARGET AUDIENCE: 
10th or 11th graders who:
* took a particular liking to the design thinking process
* particularly struggled with and need deeper understanding of the design thinking process
* are in need of math or science credits towards graduation
* came to the school particular for the maker culture and skill building
* students who have expressed personal goals that align with STEM, community care, social justice, politics, etc.
* those who find problem solving or hands-on & human-centered approaches stimulating

## TARGET AUDIENCE: 
This has to be sequential to the FOUNDATIONS in CTE course from 9th grade but then is highly adaptable and intentional in fitting alongside any course, CTE or not, as it reinforces the design thinking process as well as the school's mission of designing their own futures. It also increases the access to the makerspace and tech that which will cultivate their incorporation of CTE related skills and tech into other classes' design challenges and hopefully their own lives outside of academics
