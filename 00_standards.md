# STANDARD A
9-12.NSD.1
Design a solution to a problem that
utilizes embedded systems to
automatically gather input from the
environment.
### SAMPLE LESSON (adapted from code.org): 
After learning about the basics of what makes a computer a computer and debating out a few details through a series of peer and whole class discussions, they use design thinking to create fantasy devices or apps that address a personal, community, or global problem. An important portion of their presentation is to identify and elaborate on the input, output, and processing of data that is involved. 

# STANDARD B
9-12.IC.7
Investigate the use of computer
science in multiple fields.
## SAMPLE LESSON: 
During every -- in some years, every other -- unit, we get feedback mid project or insight at the end from professionals in roles related to the perfomance task (cumulative assessment). For example, after designing and creating a social impact video game, students prepare to share their game and research the role  and basic info related to that position (salary, education needed, etc.) before a lead game designer and one of his developers on the team visits remotely for a Q&A and/or feedback session.
