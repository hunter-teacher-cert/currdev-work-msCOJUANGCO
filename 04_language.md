# COURSE: 
## Foundations in Design
Teaches design thinking in units that are hybrid of basic Computer Science and Digital Media/Visual Arts skills and concepts. It is the 9th gr course that I'm currently teaching and developing curriculum for. The students mostly come with little CS experience other than programming Scratch via tutorials; they seem to not retian to much information unless they felt highly engaged to continue tinkering on the IDE and learning independently outside of class. A very small number of students have some html experience from middle school
