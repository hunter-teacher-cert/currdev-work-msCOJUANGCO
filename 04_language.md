# COURSE: 
## Foundations in Design
Teaches design thinking in units that are hybrid of basic Computer Science and Digital Media/Visual Arts skills and concepts. It is the 9th gr course that I'm currently teaching and developing curriculum for. The students mostly come with little CS experience other than programming Scratch via tutorials; they seem to not retian to much information unless they felt highly engaged to continue tinkering on the IDE and learning independently outside of class. A very small number of students have some html experience from middle school
# LANGUAGE: 
## Processing

# OTHER QUESTIONS
### How does one write & run code in this language?
* It is both the name of the language and the IDE which needs to be downloaded to be used. You can just run the code there at the click of a button with the display window on the interface's main view. I've also run it on Visual Studio Code but I think we had to download or modify something first.

### Rate the complexity of the syntax?
* It is simple and intended for beginners, sort of like python where you can get a sense of what the program does by just reading it, even with little to no programming experience. You can get standard things done with fewer lines relative to other languages. Also, the syntax feels more intuitive and the words used close to conversational english. I forget exactly what they said, but I learned from someone in the group that it is based on java, I think.

### Strengths
* excellent for beginners
* eases one into text based coding
* highlights the benefits of computational thinking concepts in a way that's more accessible to most beginners
*  because it's based on visuals and allows for interactivity, it is a language that helps students find debugging strategies more independently or collaboratively (student to student)
*  again, because it's based on visuals and allows for interactivity, there is a lot of room for both fun and meaningful interdisciplinary opportunities (physics for simulations, graphics for art/tech classes, etc. )
### How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
* I would defintely invite collaboration with other teachers from other departments for seamless integration and overlap of concepts and performance tasks
* I would use it as a scaffold for beginners towards languages that may be suggested by industry partners but not the most approachable for beginners
* For a game design and development unit (in both my current class AND in the unit my group is planning for this class)
  
### Weaknesses?
* like many text based languages and being visual based, this wouldn't be ideal for elementary nor middle school curriculum as, especially currently, many struggle with basic math and algebra concepts that seem to be prerequisities for the beginner level aspect of processing to be effective
  
### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
* i would have scaffolded cheat sheets on physical paper (maybe laminated to allow for reusability and interactivity) for them to use when they run into the need for math concepts (e.g. coordinate planes, etc.)
  
### Why did you select this language for this class?
* I chose it for all the reasons mentioned above as well as...
* for the accessibility to beginners
* the visual basis helps make debugging more approachable and the solution more obvious
* when they create something, the kids take a lot of pride in others' reactions to it; non programmers seem to be more impressed by things with visuals (even if they're simple and create seeminlgy complex forms from loops) i think possibly because they may not understand how much skill or levels of complexity to some other processing outputs that aren't as visually impressive
* i have a retro arcade unit idea that has a constraint of limiting the graphics of game components to be in the style of 8-bit games; this would be perfect for that!
